Instructions for the masala dosa batter:

Rinse and soak all the ingredients mentioned for dosa batter except poha/beaten rice. Soak it in good drinking water for 5-6 hours.

Now drain the water and preserve it in a container, because the same water is used while grinding. Doing so will help in better fermentation. Meanwhile soak the poha/beaten rice for 10 minutes and drain the water.

Now pour the drained ingredients and the poha/beaten rice into a wet grinder, and grind it by adding the water gradually. You can use mixer grinder as well but dont forget to increase the quantity of urad dal as mentioned in the ingredients list. Grind it till you get a smooth and fluffy batter and empty the batter into a container.

Close the lid and leave it for 8-9 hours or overnight for fermentation. Before using the batter add salt and mix well.

Instructions for making masala dosa:

Heat a flat pan or a flat non-stick pan. Smear some oil if you are using an iron pan or griddle. Don't smear oil on a non stick pan, as then you won't be able to spread the dosa batter. Spread the dosa batter in a circular way on the pan and close the lid. Wait for 5 seconds and open the lid.

Drizzle some oil /ghee / melted butter (Generally in restuarants they use ghee or butter or oil generously, and that is the reason restuarant masala dosas will be very tasty). Spread the red garlic chutney. Place 2 tbsp of potato filling, fold the dosa in which ever style you want.
