Mysore masala dosa is a very popular breakfast recipe from Mysore, Karnataka, India. In Karnataka Mysore masala dosa is just called by name "Masala dosa". Masala dosa is very popular across South India. But now we can find masala dosa getting popular in all parts of the country, and even outside the country. There are many variants in masala dosa and the recipe varies from region to region, city to city and believe me, it varies from restuarant to restuarant.

And we are all very proud of this Mysore masala dosa because Mysore Masala Dosa was ranked number 4 on the list of '10 foods to try before you die', by US newspaper The Huffington Post.

The authentic mysore masala dosa will be thick, it will be crisp from outside and a bit of soft ness or sponginess inside. For masala dosa red garlic chutney is applied as a layer from inside, 2 table spoons of potato filling (a masala prepared using potato and other spices) is placed in the middle and is served along with sambar and coconut chutney. Even in Bangalore or Mysore region of Karnataka, India not all the restuarants can serve tasty Masala dosas. Across the world people serve a thin variety of masala dosa, which I feel is not as tasty as authentic Mysore masala dosa. Also I have heard that they use same batter for idli and masala dosa. Where as in Karnataka only dosas are prepared using dosa batter. For idli we prepare separate batter.
